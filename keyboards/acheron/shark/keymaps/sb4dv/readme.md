# SB4DV Keymap

## Background
The **S**mall **B**oard **4** **D**vorak & **V**im (**SB4DV**) keymap is the eldritch fusion of these three grand designs:
 - Focus on US-Dvorak.
 - Vim-style navigation cluster.
 - Small enough to be adapted to many Ortho/Ergo boards running QMK.

The SB4DV keymap uses only 34 keys. The top 30 keys are just the alphas. There are no outer modifiers like with the [Atreus42](https://atreus.technomancy.us/), but unlike the Atreus, the full bottom row has been reduced to just 4 keys. Between the outermost layer change keys (Mods & Nums), there are only the shift and space keys.

## How To

So how does one access the modifiers?
 - Hold Mods + Tap E = Enter
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap E = Escape
 - Hold Mods + Tap B = Backspace
 - Hold Mods + Tap D = Delete
 - Hold Mods + Tap T = Tab
 - Hold Mods + Tap A = OSM Left Alt
 - Hold Mods + Tap C = OSM Left Control
 - Hold Mods + Tap W = OSM Left Windows Key
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap A = OSM Right Alt / Alt Graph
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap C = OSM Right Control
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap W = OSM Right Windows Key
 - Hold Mods + Tap U = Toggle Caps Lock (U is for "Upper Case")
 - Hold Mods + Tap I = Insert
 - Hold Mods + Tap P = Print Screen
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap P = QMK Lock (P for "Press")
 - Hold Mods + Tap S = Scroll Lock
 - (Read the source for the rest.)

Ok, what about the other keys?
 - Functon keys are on the top row of the Nums layer.
 - Number keys are on the middle/home row of the Nums layer.
 - Symbols & other punctuation are on the bottom row of the Nums layer.

And navigation?
 - Hold Mods + Tap H = Left
 - Hold Mods + Tap L = Right
 - Hold Mods + Tap K = Up
 - Hold Mods + Tap J = Down
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap H = Home
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap L = End
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap K = Page Up
 - Hold Mods + Hold Nums + Tap J = Page Down
